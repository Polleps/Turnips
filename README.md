# Turnips!
----

Turnips! is a Minecraft Fabric mod for 1.20.4 that lets you grow turnip soldiers that fight for you.

Plant turnip seeds to grow turnips, throw the turnips to spawn turnip warriors.
Throw them to against a mob, and they will try to kill it. Throw them against a cake and they'll protect it (and its direct vicinity) with their life!
